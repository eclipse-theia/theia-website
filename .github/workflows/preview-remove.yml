# SECURITY: This workflow uses pull_request_target which has access to secrets.
# It is safe because:
# 1. It only triggers on PR close (not open/sync)
# 2. It only checks out the base branch (not PR code)
# 3. It never executes any PR-controlled scripts
#
# NOTE: Do NOT add any steps that run scripts from the repository (e.g., npm install,
# npm run, or any other commands that execute repository code). Doing so would allow
# malicious PR authors to execute arbitrary code with access to repository secrets.
