# Architecture Overview

This section describes the overall architecture of Theia.

Theia is designed to work as a native desktop application as well as in the
context of a browser and a remote server. To support both situations with a
single source, Theia runs in two separate processes. Those processes are called
_frontend_ and _backend_ respectively, and they communicate through JSON-RPC
messages over WebSockets or REST APIs over HTTP. In the case of Electron, the
backend, as well as the frontend, run locally, while in a remote context the
backend would run on a remote host.

Both the frontend and backend processes have their dependency injection (DI)
container (see below) to which extensions can contribute.

## Frontend

The frontend process represents the client and renders the UI. In the browser,
it simply runs in the rendering loop, while in Electron it runs in an Electron
Window, which basically is a browser with additional Electron and Node.js APIs.
Therefore, any frontend code may assume browser as a platform but not Node.js.

The startup of the frontend process will first load the DI modules of all
contributing extensions before it obtains an instance of `FrontendApplication`
and call `start()` on it.

## Backend

The backend process runs on Node.js. We use _express_ as the HTTP server. It
may not use any code that requires a browser (DOM API) as the platform.

The startup of the backend application will first load the DI modules of all
contributing extensions before it obtains an instance of `BackendApplication`
and calls `start(portNumber)` on it.

By default the backend's express server also serves the code for the frontend.

## Separation By Platform

In an extension's top folder we have an additional layer of folders to separate
by platform:

 - The `common` folder contains code that doesn't depend on any runtime.
 - The `browser` folder contains code requiring a modern browser as a platform
   (DOM API).
 - The `electron-browser` folder contains frontend code that requires DOM API
   as well as Electron renderer-process specific APIs.
 - The `node` folder contains (backend) code requiring Node.js as a platform.
 - The `node-electron` folder contains (backend) code specific for Electron.
