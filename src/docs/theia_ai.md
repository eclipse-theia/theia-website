# Building Custom AI assistants and AI support with Theia AI

This section explains how to build custom AI assistants and integrate AI support into custom tools and IDEs using Theia AI. Theia AI, part of the Theia Platform, is a powerful framework designed to help tool builders integrate tailored AI capabilities into their tools and IDEs with ease. It provides reusable components, prompt management, LLM integration, and flexible user interfaces, allowing you to focus on delivering domain-specific AI features. This section is targeted at tool builders using Theia and Theia AI as a platform to build custom tools and IDEs. 
For detailed information on how to use the experimental AI features in the Theia IDE as an end user, refer to the [user documentation](/docs/user_ai/).

## Creating Agents with Theia AI

In this section, we will introduce the concept of agents and demonstrate how to create your own custom agents. An **Agent** in Theia AI is a self-contained component mediating between the user interface that triggers the agent, and the LLM. Thus, it is typically invoked with a user input or a UI event, collects relevant context, produces one or more prompts, handles the communication with a language model (LLM),, and invokes actions in the tool and/or returns outputs to the UI as a result. Each agent can have unique behavior based on its design.

Agents can generally be integrated into any part of the tool (e.g., terminals, editors, custom widgets) and also interact with any available and exposed API of Theia to collect context, trigger actions, or show results. A special type of agent in Theia AI is ‘Chat Agent’, which is automatically integrated into Theia AI’s default chat UI. A chat agent handles conversational interactions, making them suitable for tasks like answering questions in a chat interface.

An important design decision is how you split your AI feature set among agents. Please note that Theia AI enables any kind of modularity from one agent capable of handling many types of user requests or events to an agent delegating sub-tasks to other agents, or even several agents operating on one request. Agents can communicate with each other, so you can chain agents for one user request. This decision really depends on the specific use cases and project. Theia AI makes it easy to iteratively refine the modularity of agents while developing it. A good start is typically to start with one agent per use case.

This guide will walk you through creating agents and chat agents using Theia AI, providing a deeper understanding of the framework and how to leverage it for custom use cases.

### Creating an Agent

In general, an agent is essentially an injectable Theia service offering a specific API for its clients, such as custom widgets, editors, or menu items. Clients can obtain the instance of the agent from the agent registry or get it injected via DI, and call its methods. Usually those methods are very use case specific, often taking parameters for context that are relevant and already available to the clients calling the agents. The agent will then construct one or more prompts, obtain one or more language models, process its output, invoke actions in Theia and/or return a result to the client, e.g. to show a result message, offer follow-up questions or buttons to perform actions.

As you see, an agent is rather generic — and this is on purpose. It is designed to cater many different use cases integrated in a variety of UI components, widgets, or editors. An example of such an agent in the Theia IDE is the [code completion agent](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/blob/master/packages/ai-code-completion/src/common/code-completion-agent.ts) integrated in the code editor.
  
### Creating a Chat Agent

A **Chat Agent** is integrated into the default chat UI provided by Theia AI and thus needs to implement a more specific interface, so it can be invoked from the chat UI generically. It’s designed for conversational interaction with users.

Let’s create a new agent for the Theia IDE as an example! This new agent will assist users in identifying (and later executing) arbitrary commands in the Theia IDE, such as opening the settings or showing the toolbar. You can review the [full code of this agent](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/blob/master/packages/ai-chat/src/common/command-chat-agents.ts) as a reference.

#### Defining the Prompt Template

The first step in creating a chat agent is defining the system prompt template, which acts as the foundation for guiding how the agent interacts with the LLM.

```ts
export const commandPromptTemplate: PromptTemplate = {
   id = 'command-chat-agent-system-prompt-template';
   template = `Always respond with: “I am the command agent`;
}
```

This template sets the behavior of the agent, in the example above, it will always respond with a test String for now.

#### Creating the Chat Agent

Next, we will create the chat agent, which allows you to customize the agent’s behavior, specify its language model requirements, which prompt templates it uses, and define its interaction with users. In our case, we want to create a simple Chat Agent for which we extend the reusable base implementation provided by Theia AI (see code example below).
`AbstractChatAgent` takes care of a basic conversation flow and streaming, so we literally only need to define a name, an id, a description and which system prompt our agent uses. This agent will be available in the default chat UI and can be referenced via `@Command`. The agent will respond based on the behavior defined in the prompt.

```ts
export class CommandChatAgent extends AbstractChatAgent {
   id: string = 'Command';
   name: string = 'Command';
   description: string = `Helps users find and execute commands in the IDE`;
   variables: string[] = []; // Optional: define variables for dynamic data insertion.
   promptTemplates: PromptTemplate[] = [commandPromptTemplate];

   protected async getSystemMessage(): Promise<SystemMessage | undefined> {
       const systemPrompt = await this.promptService.getPrompt('command-system');
       return SystemMessage.fromResolvedPromptTemplate(systemPrompt);
   }
}
```

In the example above, we retrieve the prompt from Theia AIs Prompt Service. This provides features such as automatic variable resolvement. The usage of the Prompt Service is of course optional, as an agent implemented you can also simply define your own data structure if you prefer.
In the example above, we also register our prompt template with Theia AI. With this, Theia AI can provide generic features such as the prompt editor, but of course this is again up to the agent implementer whether to register prompts or not.

#### Registering the Agent

To integrate our agent with Theia AI, we need to register it. Theia as a platform is modular, so we can just register the agent along with the existing agents via dependency injection, no forking or customization of Theia framework code is required. See also the [section on services and contributions](/docs/services_and_contributions/) and specifically the [section on contribution points](https://theia-ide.org/docs/services_and_contributions/#contributing-to-contribution-points).
In the following code example, we register our agent as an ‘Agent’ and as a ‘ChatAgent’. With this, the simple agent above will already be available in the default chat, you can directly “talk” to it via typing “@Command”. In the current state, it will of course only respond with “I am the command agent”.

```ts
bind(Agent).toService(CommandChatAgent);
bind(ChatAgent).toService(CommandChatAgent);
```

#### Refine your Agent

The next step is typically the most effort and it is actually unrelated to Theia AI: You need to develop the behavior of the agent, including one or more prompts that reliably return the expected output.

In our example, we want to return an executable Theia command that the user is looking for with their question. For this, we need to augment our prompt with variables (see section “Variables and Tool Functions”) to give the LLM the necessary context information on what Theia commands are available. Moreover, we want this response in a parsable format, so that we can easily detect the command selected by the LLM in its response and provide the user with the option to directly execute the command. See the section “Response Renderers” for more details.

Getting such agent implementations right typically requires a bit of prompt evaluation with a set of expected user queries. A huge help in Theia AI is that you can modify the prompt templates at runtime to test different scenarios and tweak the prompt until you are satisfied, instead of changing the prompt templates in the code and need to rebuild after every change.

Also, if the underlying LLM supports it, structured output is a huge time saver, as this usually guarantees that the output follows a specific format and avoids coping with variations in your agent’s parsing logic.
This guide is focussed on Theia AI and not about developing specific agents per se. If you need support building your own custom AI assistance, please get in contact with a service provider and browse our [resource section](/resources/#theia-ai).


## Variables and Tool Functions

Agents often need to interact with the tool to fetch dynamic data, such as a text selection, project-data or any tool-specific data. Theia AI allows you to encapsulate this data access in Variables, which can then be used in prompts or user requests and will be resolved with the actual data from the tool at runtime. Furthermore, agents can use so-called Tool Functions that allow the underlying LLM to proactively call an action, either to retrieve more information or to trigger any kind of action including the modification of data.

### Variables

Theia AI by default supports two types of variables:

1. *Global Variables* are available to all agents. Theia and Theia AI already provide a standard set of variables, such as the currently selected text. Tool builders can easily register their own global variables to provide arbitrary additional data from the tool state, including their custom tool components. Global variables can also be used in any prompt template, but are also available to users in the default chat provided by Theia AI, e.g. “#currentText” for the currently selected text.
2. *Agent-specific Variables* are only available to specific agents (and in their prompt templates), but not to other agents and also not in the default chat.

#### Agent-specific Variables

Agent-specific variables are controlled by a specific agent. To fill a variable with data, you can literally use any internal Theia API or other external APIs or methods you like. As an example, let’s again look at the chat agent that assists users in identifying (and later executing) arbitrary commands in the Theia IDE, such as opening the settings or showing the toolbar. You can review the [full code of this agent](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/blob/master/packages/ai-chat/src/common/command-chat-agents.ts) as a reference.

To allow the underlying LLM to identify the right command, we want to send it a list with all available commands. To achieve this, we first retrieve a list of all available commands using the CommandRegistry (see code example below). This step is independent of Theia AI and you could retrieve any sort of data here instead.
Second, we resolve the variable ‘command-ids’ when receiving the system prompt’ (also see code example below).

```ts
// Retrieve all available commands
const knownCommands: string[] = [];
for (const command of this.commandRegistry.getAllCommands()) {
   knownCommands.push(`${command.id}: ${command.label}`);
}

// Resolve the variable when retrieving the system prompt
const systemPrompt = await this.promptService.getPrompt('command-chat-agent-system-prompt-template', {
   'command-ids': knownCommands.join('\n')
});
```

Please note that the manual resolvement of variables is not necessary when using global variables.
Now we can simply use our agent-specific variable in our prompt templates, e.g. like this:

```md
You are a service that helps users find commands to execute in an IDE.

These are the available commands:
Begin List:
{{command-ids}}
End List
```

If an agent uses agent-specific variables, it can decide to explicitly declare them. This enables one to keep track of used variables and optionally even show this information to the user (see example screenshot below). 

<img src="../../used-variables-command-agent.png" alt="Used variables in Theia AI" style="max-width: 525px">

To declare an agent-specific variable, simply add it like this in the constructor of your agents, along with an optional description and whether it is used in the prompt template or not.


```ts
this.agentSpecificVariables = [{
   name: 'command-ids',
   description: 'The list of available commands in Theia.',
   usedInPrompt: true
}];
```

#### Global Variables

Global variables are available to all agents. Therefore, they are provided as a dedicated contribution. In the following, we will define a simple global variable that resolves to the current date, i.e. to the time when the variable get resolved in a request. You can review the [full code of this variable](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/blob/master/packages/ai-core/src/common/today-variable-contribution.ts) for a complete description.
A Global variable basically consists of four parts.

First, we define the variable, as it can be used in requests. In the following example, we define two optional arguments to influence the format.

```ts
export const TODAY_VARIABLE: AIVariable = {
   id: 'today-provider',
   description: 'Does something for today',
   name: 'today',
   args: [
       { name: TodayVariableArgs.IN_ISO_8601, description: 'Returns the current date in ISO 8601 format' },
       { name: TodayVariableArgs.IN_UNIX_SECONDS, description: 'Returns the current date in unix seconds format' }
   ]
};
```

Second, we register the variable using an ‘AIVariableContribution’ (see code example below). Third, we resolve the variable (also see code example below). Please note that for resolving a variable, you can access all necessary APIs, including tool-specific API or custom services.

```ts
export class TodayVariableContribution implements AIVariableContribution, AIVariableResolver {
   // Register the variable resolver
   registerVariables(service: AIVariableService): void {
       service.registerResolver(TODAY_VARIABLE, this);
   }

   async resolve(request: AIVariableResolutionRequest, context: AIVariableContext): Promise<ResolvedAIVariable | undefined> {
       if (request.variable.name === TODAY_VARIABLE.name) {
           return this.resolveTodayVariable(request);
       }
       return undefined;
   }

   private resolveTodayVariable(request: AIVariableResolutionRequest): ResolvedTodayVariable {
       const date = new Date();
       if (request.arg === TodayVariableArgs.IN_ISO_8601) {
           return { variable: request.variable, value: date.toISOString(), date };
       }
       if (request.arg === TodayVariableArgs.IN_UNIX_SECONDS) {
           return { variable: request.variable, value: Math.round(date.getTime() / 1000).toString(), date };
       }
       return { variable: request.variable, value: date.toDateString(), date };
   }
}

...

bind(AIVariableContribution).to(TodayVariableContribution).inSingletonScope();
```

It can now be used in any prompt template, as well as in user requests.

### Tool Functions

Tool functions allow an agent to provide capabilities to the underlying LLM. Compared to variables, it is up to the LLM to decide whether to use an available function or not. Functions can be used to allow the LLM to retrieve additional information or to trigger actions in the tool. Actions can be literally anything you want the LLM to be able to trigger, including modifications of data. Tool Functions can be used in requests, similarly to variables as shown in the following prompt example:

```md
Use the following functions to access the workspace:
- ~{getWorkspaceFileList}
- ~{getFileContent}.
```

To implement your own tool functions, provide an implementation of interface ‘ToolProvider’, in which you specify the ID, optionally parameters and a handler that represented the function to be called, e.g. like this:

```typescript
@injectable()
export class FileContentFunction implements ToolProvider {
   static ID = FILE_CONTENT_FUNCTION_ID;

   getTool(): ToolRequest {
       return {
           id: FileContentFunction.ID,
           name: FileContentFunction.ID,
           description: 'Get the content of the file',
           parameters: {
               type: 'object',
               properties: {
                   file: {
                       type: 'string',
                       description: 'The path of the file to retrieve content for',
                   }
               }
           },
           handler: (arg_string: string) => {
               const file = this.parseArg(arg_string);
               return this.getFileContent(file);
           }
       };
   }
}

```

See [here](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/blob/master/packages/ai-workspace-agent/src/browser/functions.ts) for the full example listed above. In the handler, you can call literally any available API to execute arbitrary actions or retrieve arbitrary content, including tool-specific things.

Finally, register your ‘ToolProvider’ like this:

```typescript
bind(ToolProvider).to(FileContentFunction);
```

## Custom Response Part Rendering

This section explains the process of converting an LLM (Large Language Model) response into custom UI controls within the Theia AI default chat (or any custom chat implementation). Custom UI control can be specially highlighted text, clickable buttons or literally anything that you want to display to your users.
As an example, we will use the command chat agent used in this documentation before, which is capable of identifying a command in the Theia IDE based on the user's request. We will augment this agent to render commands that the agent returns as buttons. By clicking the button, users can then directly invoke a command.

Let’s look at the basic control flow of a chat request in Theia AI (see diagram below). The flow starts with a user request in the default Chat UI (1), which is sent to the underlying LLM (2) to return an answer (3). By default, the agent can forward the response to the Chat UI as-is. However, in our scenario, the agent will parse the response and augment it with a structured response content (4). Based on this, the chat UI can select a corresponding response part renderer to be shown in the UI (5).

<img src="../../architecture-renderers.png" alt="Request Response flow in Theia AI" style="max-width: 650px">

In the following, we will dive into the details on how to implement this flow.

### Develop a Reliable Prompt

The first step to enable structured response parsing is developing a prompt that reliably returns the expected output. In this case, the output should include an executable Theia command related to the user's question in JSON format. The response needs to be in a parsable format, allowing the system to detect the command and provide the user with the option to execute it.

An simplified example of such a prompt might look like the following (you can review the full prompt template [here](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/blob/master/packages/ai-chat/src/common/command-chat-agents.ts))

```md
You are a service that helps users find commands to execute in an IDE.  
You reply with stringified JSON Objects that tell the user which command to execute and its arguments, if any.

Example:

\`\`\`json
{
   "type": "theia-command",
   "commandId": "workbench.action.selectIconTheme"
}
\`\`\`

Here are the known Theia commands:

Begin List:  
{{command-ids}}
End List
```

As described in the previous section the variable `{{command-ids}}` is dynamically populated with the list of available commands.

### Parse the Response and Transform into Response Content

After receiving the LLM response, the next step is to parse it in the agent implementation and transform it into a response content that can then be processed by the Chat UI. In the following code example:

- The LLM response is parsed into a command object.
- The Theia command corresponding to the parsed command ID is retrieved.
- A `CommandChatResponseContentImpl` object is created to wrap the command.

You can review the parsing code, including error handling  [here](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/blob/master/packages/ai-chat/src/common/command-chat-agents.ts))

Example code:

```typescript
const parsedCommand = JSON.parse(jsonString) as ParsedCommand;
const theiaCommand = this.commandRegistry.getCommand(parsedCommand.commandId);
return new CommandChatResponseContentImpl(theiaCommand);
```
Please note that a chat response can contain a list of response parts, allowing various UI components to be mixed with actionable response components.

### Create and Register a Response Part Renderer

The final step is to display a button in the Chat UI to allow users to execute the command. This is done by creating a new Response Part Renderer. The renderer is registered to handle `CommandChatResponseContent`, ensuring that the Chat UI calls it whenever a corresponding content type is part of the response.

The following example code shows the corresponding response renderer, you can review the full code [here](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/blob/master/packages/ai-chat-ui/src/browser/chat-response-renderer/command-part-renderer.tsx).

- **`canHandle` Method**: Determines whether the renderer can handle the response part. If the response is of type `CommandChatResponseContent`, it returns a positive value, indicating it can process the content.
- **`render` Method**: Displays a button if the command is enabled. If the command is not executable globally, a message is shown.
- **`onCommand` Method**: Executes the command when the button is clicked.

```typescript
canHandle(response: ChatResponseContent): number {
    if (isCommandChatResponseContent(response)) {
        return 10;
    }
    return -1;
}

render(response: CommandChatResponseContent): ReactNode {
    const isCommandEnabled = this.commandRegistry.isEnabled(response.command.id);
    return (
        isCommandEnabled ? (
            <button className='theia-button main' onClick={this.onCommand.bind(this)}>{response.command.label}</button>
        ) : (
            <div>The command has the id "{response.command.id}" but it is not executable globally from the Chat window.</div>
        )
    );
}

private onCommand(arg: AIChatCommandArguments): void {
    this.commandService.executeCommand(arg.command.id);
}
```

Finally, the custom response renderer needs to be registered:

```typescript
bind(ChatResponsePartRenderer).to(CommandPartRenderer).inSingletonScope();
```

By following the steps outlined, you can transform an LLM response into custom and optionally actionable UI controls within Theia AI. See [the Theia IDE documentation](https://theia-ide.org/docs/user_ai/#command-chat-agent) on how the example looks integrated in a tool. 
This approach enables users to interact with the AI-powered Chat UI more efficiently, e.g. allowing executing commands directly from the suggestions provided.

## Custom LLM Provider

Theia AI currently provides out-of-the-box support for any OpenAI-compatible LLM services (including the OpenAI models hosted by OpenAI or self-hosted compatible LLMs) and Ollama LLMs. We are also working on integrating support for LLamaFile. As a tool provider, you can easily add support for other LLM APIs too. Please consider contributing any further LLM providers to the open source project, so that the community can benefit from increased compatibility and share the maintenance cost.

To support a specific LLM, you basically need to provide an implementation of the interface ‘LanguageModel’, which provides an abstraction between agents and the underlying LLM. This Language Model is then registered at the ‘LanguageModelRegistry’, to make it retrievable for agents, e.g. like this:


```typescript
this.languageModelRegistry.addLanguageModels([new OllamaModel());
```

If you want to allow the user to configure the LLM provider, e.g. change the URL or the available models, consider integrating your LLM provider with Theias preference system.

For further details, we recommend reviewing the available LLM provider in Theia AI:

* [OpenAI LLM Provider](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/tree/master/packages/ai-openai)
* [Ollama LLM Provider](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/tree/master/packages/ai-ollama)

Please note that Theia AI currently does not provide a fixed contribution point for Language Models, yet. This is due to the fact that we are working on supporting more models and also capabilities of new LLMs are emerging at the moment, such as function calling and structured output. We plan to consolidate the LLM Provider interfaces within the next months while adding more LLM Providers to the core framework. We are happy for feedback and contributions in this area.
