# Getting started

In this section, we provide a high level overview on how to get started with Eclipse Theia and link to respective sections to read.
Eclipse Theia is a platform for building custom Cloud & Desktop IDEs and tools with modern web technologies. The Eclipse Theia Platform is not a tool itself, but there are many tools which are built upon Theia. The Theia project provides a tool called [Eclipse Theia IDE](../../#theiaide) that can be directly used. The Theia IDE can also be [used as a template](../blueprint_documentation/) to get started with building your own tool. Please have a look at the project goals for more details!

## Use Eclipse Theia (IDE)

You cannot directly launch/use Theia as it is a platform. The project provides one tool called [Eclipse IDE](../../#theiaide) that you can directly download and use. Further, it is very easy to [create your own product based on Theia](../composing_applications/). Please also refer to [this article](https://eclipsesource.com/de/blogs/2019/09/25/how-to-launch-eclipse-theia/) highlighting the various options available to [launch/try Eclipse Theia and Theia-based products](https://eclipsesource.com/de/blogs/2019/09/25/how-to-launch-eclipse-theia/).

## Build a tool or IDE based on Eclipse Theia

The first step is to define a custom product based on Theia. Please check out the guide on [how to build your own IDE or tool based on Theia](../composing_applications/). Subsequently, you might want to extend this product with your own feature for which you can use the [available extension mechanisms of Theia](../extensions/).

## Frequently Asked Questions

If you are unsure what Theia is, how it compares to other technologies or how to migrate Eclipse-based tools to it, please have a look at [resource section](../../resources/).
