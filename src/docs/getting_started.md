# Getting started

In this section, we provide a high level overview on how to get started with Eclipse Theia and link to respective sections to read.
Eclipse Theia is a platform for building custom Cloud & Desktop IDEs and tools with modern web technologies. Eclipse Theia is not a tool itself, but there are many tools which are built upon Theia. Theia as a project provides a template tool called [Eclipse Blueprint](https://theia-ide.org/docs/blueprint_download/) to try Theia and get started with building your own tool. Please have a look at the project goals for more details!
