# Communication via JSON-RPC

In this section I will explain how you can create a backend service and
then connect to it over JSON-RPC.

I will use the debug logging system as a small example of that.

## Overview

This works by creating a service exposed by the express framework and
then connecting to that over a websocket connection.

## Registering a service

So the first thing you will want to do is expose your service so that the
frontend can connect to it.

You will need to create backend server module file similar to this (logger-server-module.ts):

``` typescript

import { ContainerModule } from 'inversify';
import { ConnectionHandler, JsonRpcConnectionHandler } from "../../messaging/common";
import { ILoggerServer, ILoggerClient } from '../../application/common/logger-protocol';

export const loggerServerModule = new ContainerModule(bind => {
    bind(ConnectionHandler).toDynamicValue(ctx =>
        new JsonRpcConnectionHandler<ILoggerClient>("/services/logger", client => {
            const loggerServer = ctx.container.get<ILoggerServer>(ILoggerServer);
            loggerServer.setClient(client);
            return loggerServer;
        })
    ).inSingletonScope()
});
```

Let's go over that in detail:

``` typescript
import { ConnectionHandler, JsonRpcConnectionHandler } from "../../messaging/common";
```

This imports the `JsonRpcConnectionHandler`, this factory enables you to create
a connection handler that onConnection creates proxy object to the object that
is called in the backend over JSON-RPC and expose a local object to JSON-RPC.

We'll see more on how this is done as we go.

The `ConnectionHandler` is a simple interface that specifies the path of the
connection and what happens on connection creation.

It looks like this:

``` typescript
import { MessageConnection } from "vscode-jsonrpc";

export const ConnectionHandler = Symbol('ConnectionHandler');

export interface ConnectionHandler {
    readonly path: string;
    onConnection(connection: MessageConnection): void;
}
```

``` typescript
import { ILoggerServer, ILoggerClient } from '../../application/common/logger-protocol';
```

The logger-protocol.ts file contains the interfaces that the server and the
client need to implement.

The server here means the backend object that will be called over JSON-RPC
and the client is a client object that can receive notifications from the
backend object.

I'll get more into that later.

``` typescript
    bind<ConnectionHandler>(ConnectionHandler).toDynamicValue(ctx => {
```

Here a bit of magic happens, at first glance we're just saying here's an
implementation of a ConnectionHandler.

The magic here is that this ConnectionHandler type is bound to a
ContributionProvider in messaging-module.ts

So as the MessagingContribution starts (onStart is called) it creates a
websocket connection for all bound ConnectionHandlers.

like so (from messaging-module.ts):

``` typescript
constructor( @inject(ContributionProvider) @named(ConnectionHandler) protected readonly handlers: ContributionProvider<ConnectionHandler>) {
    }

    onStart(server: http.Server): void {
        for (const handler of this.handlers.getContributions()) {
            const path = handler.path;
            try {
                createServerWebSocketConnection({
                    server,
                    path
                }, connection => handler.onConnection(connection));
            } catch (error) {
                console.error(error)
            }
        }
    }
```

To dig more into ContributionProvider see this [section](Services_and_Contributions#contribution-providers).

So now:

``` typescript
new JsonRpcConnectionHandler<ILoggerClient>("/services/logger", client => {
```

This does a few things if we look at this class implementation:

``` typescript
export class JsonRpcConnectionHandler<T extends object> implements ConnectionHandler {
    constructor(
        readonly path: string,
        readonly targetFactory: (proxy: JsonRpcProxy<T>) => any
    ) { }

    onConnection(connection: MessageConnection): void {
        const factory = new JsonRpcProxyFactory<T>(this.path);
        const proxy = factory.createProxy();
        factory.target = this.targetFactory(proxy);
        factory.listen(connection);
    }
}
```

We see that a websocket connection is created on path: "logger" by the extension of the ConnectionHandler class with the path attribute set to "logger".

And let's look at what it does onConnection :

``` typescript
    onConnection(connection: MessageConnection): void {
        const factory = new JsonRpcProxyFactory<T>(this.path);
        const proxy = factory.createProxy();
        factory.target = this.targetFactory(proxy);
        factory.listen(connection);
```


Let's go over this line by line:

``` typescript
    const factory = new JsonRpcProxyFactory<T>(this.path);
```

This creates a JsonRpcProxy on path "logger".

``` typescript
    const proxy = factory.createProxy();
```

Here we create a proxy object from the factory, this will be used to call
the other end of the JSON-RPC connection using the ILoggerClient interface.

``` typescript
    factory.target = this.targetFactory(proxy);
```

This will call the function we've passed in parameter so:

``` typescript
        client => {
            const loggerServer = ctx.container.get<ILoggerServer>(ILoggerServer);
            loggerServer.setClient(client);
            return loggerServer;
        }
```

This sets the client on the loggerServer, in this case this is used to
send notifications to the frontend about a log level change.

And it returns the loggerServer as the object that will be exposed over JSON-RPC.

``` typescript
 factory.listen(connection);
```

This connects the factory to the connection.

The endpoints with `services/*` path are served by the webpack dev server, see `webpack.config.js`:

``` javascript
    '/services/*': {
        target: 'ws://localhost:3000',
        ws: true
    },
```

## Connecting to a service

So now that we have a backend service let's see how to connect to it from
the frontend.

To do that you will need something like this:

(From logger-frontend-module.ts)

``` typescript
import { ContainerModule, Container } from 'inversify';
import { WebSocketConnectionProvider } from '../../messaging/browser/connection';
import { ILogger, LoggerFactory, LoggerOptions, Logger } from '../common/logger';
import { ILoggerServer } from '../common/logger-protocol';
import { LoggerWatcher } from '../common/logger-watcher';

export const loggerFrontendModule = new ContainerModule(bind => {
    bind(ILogger).to(Logger).inSingletonScope();
    bind(LoggerWatcher).toSelf().inSingletonScope();
    bind(ILoggerServer).toDynamicValue(ctx => {
        const loggerWatcher = ctx.container.get(LoggerWatcher);
        const connection = ctx.container.get(WebSocketConnectionProvider);
        return connection.createProxy<ILoggerServer>("/services/logger", loggerWatcher.getLoggerClient());
    }).inSingletonScope();
});
```

The important bit here are those lines:

``` typescript
    bind(ILoggerServer).toDynamicValue(ctx => {
        const loggerWatcher = ctx.container.get(LoggerWatcher);
        const connection = ctx.container.get(WebSocketConnectionProvider);
        return connection.createProxy<ILoggerServer>("/services/logger", loggerWatcher.getLoggerClient());
    }).inSingletonScope();

```

Let's go line by line:

``` typescript
        const loggerWatcher = ctx.container.get(LoggerWatcher);
```

Here we're creating a watcher, this is used to get notified about events
from the backend by using the loggerWatcher client
(loggerWatcher.getLoggerClient())

See more information about how events work in theia [here](Events.md#events).

``` typescript
        const connection = ctx.container.get(WebSocketConnectionProvider);
```

Here we're getting the websocket connection, this will be used to create a proxy from.

``` typescript
        return connection.createProxy<ILoggerServer>("/services/logger", loggerWatcher.getLoggerClient());
```

As the second argument, we pass a local object to handle JSON-RPC messages from the remote object.
Sometimes the local object depends on the proxy and cannot be instantiated before the proxy is instantiated.
In such cases, the proxy interface should implement `JsonRpcServer` and the local object should be provided as a client.

```ts
export type JsonRpcServer<Client> = Disposable & {
    setClient(client: Client | undefined): void;
};

export interface ILoggerServer extends JsonRpcServery<ILoggerClient> {
    // ...
}

const serverProxy = connection.createProxy<ILoggerServer>("/services/logger");
const client = loggerWatcher.getLoggerClient();
serverProxy.setClient(client);
```

So here at the last line we're binding the ILoggerServer interface to a
JsonRpc proxy.

Note that his under the hood calls:

``` typescript
 createProxy<T extends object>(path: string, target?: object, options?: WebSocketOptions): T {
        const factory = new JsonRpcProxyFactory<T>(path, target);
        this.listen(factory, options);
        return factory.createProxy();
    }
```

So it's very similar to the backend example.

Maybe you've noticed too but as far as the connection is concerned the frontend
is the server and the backend is the client. But that doesn't really
matter in our logic.

So again there's multiple things going on here what this does is that:
 - it creates a JsonRpc Proxy on path "logger".
 - it exposes the loggerWatcher.getLoggerClient() object.
 - it returns a proxy of type ILoggerServer.

So now instances of ILoggerServer are proxied over JSON-RPC to the
backend's LoggerServer object.

## Loading the modules in the example backend and frontend

So now that we have these modules we need to wire them into the example.
We will use the browser example for this, note that it's the same code for
the electron example.

### Backend

In examples/browser/src/backend/main.ts you will need something like:

``` typescript
import { loggerServerModule } from 'theia-core/lib/application/node/logger-server-module';
```

And than load that into the main container:

``` typescript
container.load(loggerServerModule);
```

### Frontend

In examples/browser/src/frontend/main.ts you will need something like:

``` typescript
import { loggerFrontendModule } from 'theia-core/lib/application/browser/logger-frontend-module';
```

``` typescript
container.load(frontendLanguagesModule);
```

## Complete example

this documentation see [this commit](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/commit/99d191f19bd2a3e93098470ca1bb7b320ab344a1).
