## Events

Events in Theia can be confusing, hopefully we can clarify things.

Let's consider this code:

(From logger-watcher.ts)
``` typescript
@injectable()
export class LoggerWatcher {

    getLoggerClient(): ILoggerClient {
        const emitter = this.onLogLevelChangedEmitter
        return {
            onLogLevelChanged(event: ILogLevelChangedEvent) {
                emitter.fire(event)
            }
        }
    }

    private onLogLevelChangedEmitter = new Emitter<ILogLevelChangedEvent>();

    get onLogLevelChanged(): Event<ILogLevelChangedEvent> {
        return this.onLogLevelChangedEmitter.event;
    }
}
```

Let's start with:

``` typescript
    private onLogLevelChangedEmitter = new Emitter<ILogLevelChangedEvent>();
```

So first what is an `Emitter`?

An Emitter is an event handler container,
it allows for event handlers to be registered on it and triggered with an
event of type X in this case an ILogLevelChangedEvent.

So here we just create an `Emitter` that will have events of type ILogLevelChangedEvent;

Next we want to be able to register an event handler on this `Emitter` to
do so we do this:

``` typescript
    get onLogLevelChanged(): Event<ILogLevelChangedEvent> {
        return this.onLogLevelChangedEmitter.event;
    }
```

What this actually returns is a function that will register an event
handler so you just pass it your event handler function and it will
register it so that it's called when the event fires.

so you can call:

(From logger.ts)
``` typescript
 /* Update the root logger log level if it changes in the backend. */
        loggerWatcher.onLogLevelChanged(event => {
            this.id.then(id => {
                if (id === this.rootLoggerId) {
                    this._logLevel = Promise.resolve(event.newLogLevel);
                }
            });
        });
```

This registers the anonymous function passed as param on this emitter.

Next we will need to trigger this event handler by firing an event:

``` typescript
 onLogLevelChanged(event: ILogLevelChangedEvent) {
                emitter.fire(event)
            }
```

When calling this function, the emitter fires and all the event handlers
are called.

So if you need to trigger events in theia:

 - Create an emitter
 - Register events with the emitter.event function
 - Fire events with emitter.fire(event)
