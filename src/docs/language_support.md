# Language Support

Theia uses standard technologies for adding language support to custom Theia-based products. By integrating the Monaco Code Editor, Theia supports the language server protocol (LSP) as well as TextMate.

We recommend you use VS Code Extensions which the Theia Framework [supports](../authoring_vscode_extensions) in order to add support for an existing or a custom language. Please refer to the [VS Code Language Support](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/overview) documentation for additional details.
